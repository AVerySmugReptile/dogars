Dogars
=======

Install with ```npm install```. Build with gulp. Edit the service file to use your path if you use 
systemd.

Edit ```settings.json``` as you see fit. There's supposed to be a table named ```Sets``` in your database.
You could infer the proper schema from the code, or get a database dump from dogars.ml.

Currently, the application runs on dogars.ml on port 1234 and an nginx rule redirects traffic from port 80 to port 1234.

Works on my machineÂ©.

  not been used to transmit data, and a lot of the features rely on
  this.

- The site is ugly on mobile, but deal with it dumb phoneposter.

- Database backup every hour, and preserves every previous backups, just in case.
