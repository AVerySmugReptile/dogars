Dogars
=======

Install with ```npm install```, wait for a bit (needs to compile mariasql from source).

Edit ```settings.json``` as you see fit. There's supposed to be a table named ```Sets``` in your database.
You could infer the proper schema from the code, or get a database dump from dogars.ml.

Currently, the application runs on dogars.ml on port 1234 and an nginx rule redirects traffic from port 80 to port 1234.

Works on my machineÂ©.
